    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes
        that I have read over the years.<br>
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
        grilled meats and pitta breads.<br>
    </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) <br>
        175g of tahini<br>
        6 sundried tomatoes<br>
        Half a red pepper<br>
        A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
        1 clove of garlic<br>
        A dash of olive oil<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li><br>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li><br>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li><br>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li><br>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li><br>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li><br>
    </ol>

    <p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime
        and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<br>
    </p>

    <h2> Storage</h2>

    <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after
        you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.<br>
    </p>
