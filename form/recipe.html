    <h1> <strong> Quick hummus recipe</strong></h1>

    <p>
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes
        that I have read over the years.<br>
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
        grilled meats and pitta breads.<br>
    </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p> <em> can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) </em><br>
        <em>75g of tahini</em><br>
        <em>6 sundried tomatoes</em><br>
        <em>Half a red pepper</em><br>
        <em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em><br>
        <em> clove of garlic</em><br>
        <em>A dash of olive oil</em><br>
    </p>

        Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
        Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
        Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
        If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
        If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
    </p>

    <p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime
        and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<br>
    </p>

    <h2> Storage</h2>

    <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after
        you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.<br>
